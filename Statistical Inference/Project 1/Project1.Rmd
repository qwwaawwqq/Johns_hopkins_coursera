# Exponential Distribution and Central Limit Theorem

## Overview
In this project, we will investigate the exponential distribution in R and compare it with the Central Limit Theorem. We will simulate the distribution of averages of 40 exponentials and examine its properties.

## Simulations
We will use the `rexp()` function in R to simulate the exponential distribution. The mean and standard deviation of the exponential distribution are both equal to 1/lambda, where lambda is the rate parameter. We set lambda = 0.2 for all simulations.

To simulate the distribution of averages of 40 exponentials, we will perform 1000 simulations:

```{r}
set.seed(42)
lambda <- 0.2
n <- 40
num_sims <- 1000

sim_means <- replicate(num_sims, mean(rexp(n, lambda)))

#Sample Mean versus Theoretical Mean
#The theoretical mean of the exponential distribution is 1/lambda. Let's compare the sample mean from our simulations to the theoretical mean:

theoretical_mean <- 1/lambda
sample_mean <- mean(sim_means)

paste("Theoretical Mean:", theoretical_mean)
paste("Sample Mean:", sample_mean)

#We can visualize the distribution of sample means using a histogram:

hist(sim_means, main = "Distribution of Sample Means", xlab = "Sample Mean")
abline(v = theoretical_mean, col = "red", lwd = 2)

#The red vertical line represents the theoretical mean.
#Sample Variance versus Theoretical Variance
#The theoretical variance of the exponential distribution is (1/lambda)^2. Let's compare the sample variance from our simulations to the theoretical variance:

theoretical_var <- (1/lambda)^2
sample_var <- var(sim_means)

paste("Theoretical Variance:", theoretical_var)
paste("Sample Variance:", sample_var)

#Distribution
#To check if the distribution of sample means is approximately normal, we can create a histogram and a Q-Q plot:

hist(sim_means, main = "Distribution of Sample Means", xlab = "Sample Mean", prob = TRUE)
lines(density(sim_means), col = "blue", lwd = 2)

qqnorm(sim_means)
qqline(sim_means)

#If the distribution is approximately normal, the histogram should resemble a bell curve, and the Q-Q plot should show the points falling close to the straight line.
